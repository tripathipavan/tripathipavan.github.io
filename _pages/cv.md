Work experience
======
* **Project Associate III**, Quantum Security Research Lab (QSRL), SETS, Chennai
**June 6, 2025 - Present**
  * <u>Project:</u> *Quantum Internet with Local Access (QuILA)* under National Quantum Mission (NQM)
  * <u>Objective:</u> Security testing, evaluation, and validation of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems
  * <u>Responsibilities:</u>
    * **Co-leading** the establishment of a national reference laboratory in India for QKD security evaluation.
    * **Managing procurement and characterization** of cutting-edge laboratory equipments - single frequency laser, drivers, photoreceivers, single photon detectors, modulator drivers, bias controllers, etc.
    * Studying **ISO 23837-1, ISO 23837-2, and  Europe's ETSI QKD** standards to support QKD certification efforts.


* **Project Associate I and II**, Hardware Security Research Group (HSRG), SETS, Chennai
**Nov 1, 2023 - May 27, 2025**
  * <u>Project:</u> *Post-Quantum Cryptography based Public-Key Infrastructure (PQC-PKI)*
  * <u>Objective:</u> Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) and validation of PQC algorithms
  * <u>Responsibilities:</u> 
    * **Automated the validation of cryptographic modules**- all modes of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Galois Counter Mode (GCM), and Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG) using C.
    * Knowledgable in **ISO 19790 and ISO 24759** for the security and test requirements of cryptographic modules.
    * Knowledgable in  **ISO 17825** for the mitigation of non-invasive atacks i.e. SCA against cryptographic modules.
    * Knowledgable in  **NIST SP 800-90 A, B, and C** for the generation of random bits.
    * Automated the **Entropy Source Validation (ESV)** of random bit generators based on NIST SP800-90B using C and Python.
    * Estimated and validated the entropy of a Ring-Oscillator (RO) based True Random Number Generator (TRNG) developed by a collaborator.
  * <u>Outcomes:</u>
    * **Evaluated** the collaborator's IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) claim for the RO based TRNG, and based on test results, provided constructive feedback and alternative strategies to achieve a more robust and reliable TRNG for PQC-PKI applications.
