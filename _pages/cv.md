Education
======
* **Master of Science (By Research) in Electrical Engineering**, *Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK)*, 2024
  * Completed all course and thesis credits: August 2023
  * Thesis submission: May 2024; Thesis defense: August 2024
* **Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics Engineering**, *Datta Meghe College of Engineering (DMCE), University of Mumbai*, 2016

Work experience
======
* **Project Associate III**, Quantum Security Research Lab (QSRL), SETS, Chennai
**June 6, 2025 - Present**
  * Project: *Quantum Internet with Local Access (QuILA)* under National Quantum Mission (NQM)
  * Objective: Security testing and validation of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems
  * Responsibilities:
    * Co-leading the establishment of the **Quantum Hacking Laboratory**
    * Managing procurement of cutting-edge laboratory equipment - single frequency laser, drivers, photoreceivers, single photon detectors, modulator drivers, bias controllers, etc.
    * Performing security testing and validation of QKD systems developed by collabo

* **Project Associate I and II**, Hardware Security Research Group (HSRG), SETS, Chennai
**Nov 1, 2023 - May 27, 2025**
  * Project: *Post-Quantum Cryptography based Public-Key Infrastructure (PQC-PKI)*
  * Objective: Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) and validation of PQC algorithms
  * Responsibilities: 
    * Automated the validation of cryptographic modules- all modes of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Galois Counter Mode (GCM), and Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG) using C.
    * Knowledgable in ISO 19790 and ISO 24759 for the security and test requirements of cryptographic modules.
    * Knowledgable in  ISO 17825 for the mitigation of non-invasive atacks i.e. SCA against cryptographic modules.
    * Knowledgable in  NIST SP 800-90 A, B, and C for the generation of random bits.
    * Automated the Entropy Source Validation (ESV) of random bit generators based on NIST SP800-90B using C and Python.
    * Estimated and validated the entropy of a Ring-Oscillator (RO) based True Random Number Generator (TRNG) developed by a collaborator.
  * Outcomes:
    * Evaluated the Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) claim made by the collaborator on RO based TRNG, and based on testing data, provided constructive feedback and alternative approaches that can lead to a more robust and reliable TRNG for PQC-PKI.
