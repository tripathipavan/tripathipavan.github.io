Work experience
======
* June 6, 2025 - Present: Project Associate III, Quantum Security Research Group (QSRG), SETS, Chennai.
  * Project: Quantum Internet with Local Access (QuILA) under National Quantum Mission (NQM).
  * Objective: Security Testing and Validation of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems and services.
  * Current Duties:
    * Co-leading in the establishment of the Quantum Hacking Laboratory at QSRG.
    * Managing the procurement of cutting-edge laboratory equipments, including single frequency laser and driver, photoreceiver module, single photon detector, modulator driver and bias controller, etc, while adhering to a 1.5 crores budget.
    * 

* Nov 1, 2023 - May 27, 2025: Project Associate I and II, Hardware Security Research Group (HSRG), SETS, Chennai.
  * Project: Post-Quantum Cryptography based Public-Key Infrastructure (PQC-PKI).
  * Objective: Side-Channel Analysis (SCA) and Validation of PQC algorithms.
  * Duties accomplished: 
    * Automated the validation of cryptographic modules- all modes of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Galois Counter Mode (GCM), and Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG) using C.
    * Knowledgable in ISO 19790 and ISO 24759 for the security and test requirements of cryptographic modules.
    * Knowledgable in  ISO 17825 for the mitigation of non-invasive atacks i.e. SCA against cryptographic modules.
    * Knowledgable in  NIST SP 800-90 A, B, and C for the generation of random bits.
    * Automated the Entropy Source Validation (ESV) of random bit generators based on NIST SP800-90B using C and Python.
    * Estimated and validated the entropy of a Ring-Oscillator (RO) based True Random Number Generator (TRNG) developed by a collaborator.
  * Outcomes:
    * Evaluated the Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) claim made by the collaborator on RO based TRNG, and based on testing data, provided constructive feedback and alternative approaches that can lead to a more robust and reliable TRNG for PQC-PKI.
