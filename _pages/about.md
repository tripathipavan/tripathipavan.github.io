Welcome to my website!


About Me
======
I work as a **Project Associate III** at the [Society for Electronic Transactions and Security (SETS)](https://setsindia.in/) in Chennai, India, where I work within the **Quantum Security Research Lab**. I hold an **MS by Research** in Electrical Engineering (Photonics) from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK)](https://www.iitk.ac.in/).

My current work involves the security evaluation, testing, and validation of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems. Previously, I have worked on cryptographic modules validation at SETS. I have implemented high-speed True Random-Bit Generators (TRBGs) for Frequency Coded-QKD system at IITK.
 
Key Research Interests
======
1. Quantum security - Develop methodologies for security evaluation of QKD systems.
2. Quantum communications - Theory and Experimental.
3. Quantum cryptography - develop new protocols with security proofs.
3. Physical random number generators (RNGs) and entropy sources.
5. Electro-optical system and product development.
4. Hardware security and side-channel analysis (SCA) of cryptographic modules.
6. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs).

Beyond Research
======
Outside of research, I enjoy long-distance running, cycling, yoga, and reading newspapers & books. I also enjoy teaching/mentoring students.

Contact & Opportunities
======
I am open to research, industry, and entrepreneurial opportunities.
Please feel free to contact me via email regarding potential
collaborations or positions. 

News & Updates
======
- **June '25:** Promoted to Project Associate III at SETS, working on the QuILA project under NQM.
- **Aug '24:** Successfully defended my Master's thesis on "True Random Number Generation using Phase Noise, Chaos, and Amplified Spontaneous Emission Noise".
